# Description

BogoSort is a joke sorting algorithm which just randomizes the list until it's sorted.
This repo contains a playground called ```BogoSort.cpp``` and a ```readytouse``` folder to build it into other programs.
*(Why ~~would~~ **wouldn't** you do that?)*

---

## Compile on Windows with GCC

GCC:

```
g++ -o BogoSort.exe BogoSort.cpp
```

---

**Notice:** The playground is Windows-only.
